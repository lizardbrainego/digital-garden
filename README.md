# Digital Garden (Jekyll)

A minimal, quiet digital garden built with Jekyll and designed for evergreen notes, backlinks, and tags — without flashy marketing.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public). Suggested name: `digital-garden`.
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repo root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Build and deployment**: Source = `GitHub Actions` (recommended) or `Deploy from a branch`.
   - If using actions: GitHub will detect Jekyll via the workflow included by GitHub Pages automatically.
4. (Optional) Set a custom domain in **Settings → Pages** once DNS is ready.
5. Your site will publish at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>` or your custom domain.

## Local Preview
- You can use `bundle exec jekyll serve` locally (requires Ruby and Bundler).
- Or skip local and push to GitHub Pages; it will build for you.

## Content model
- `notes/` is an evergreen collection. Each note has front matter with `title` and optional `tags`.
- Backlinks are auto-generated by scanning other notes for links to the current note.
- Tags are built without plugins using Liquid.
